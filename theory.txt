Datatypes in js:
Data is the information on which we need to implement business logic to get the desired output.

to perform any operation on the datatbase need to understand the data type.   

typeof :operator used  to identifer  the type ofdata.


types:
there are two types of the data
1.primitive data type
2.Non primitive data type

1. primitive data type:
-
 -Abitity to store a single  value
-Data will be store in stack memory directly
-once data has been created in memoryit.
-it is not to possible to change. it will is created a new memory locationto store the data.  
-so value of variable will be changed

-once created is called an immutability(fixed)

types of primitive  data type
number

string =>denoted as '',"",''etc
Boolean
null
undefined
symbol(ES6)


Boolean: boolean data values can be represent with true or false.
null:null is special value give to any vaiable.

2.Non primitive data type:
-Ability to store multiple value
-Data will be store in the heap memory with the help of reference from stack memory
-once data is been create in memory
-the data will be shared to another variavle also,
-once value is created it is possible to change
-it is called as mutability

type of non primitive
Array

Array is collection/combination of similar typeof or different datatype value(element).
suppose example
var a=[1,2,3,4];=>Array to number
var a=['a,'b'];=>Array of string
var arrayboolean=[true,false]=>Array of boolean
var arrauNull=[null,null];=>Array of null
var multipletypes=['1','2',3',null,'undefined'];

object
object:object are the collection of key value pair{key:value}
var numbers={
key1: value1',
key2: value2',
key3: value3',
key4: value4',
key5: value5',
}
