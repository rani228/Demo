1.what is mean by javascript?
=>JavaScript is programming language that allows you to create interaction, dynamic behaviour on website.
javascript is high level language.
javascript is an interpreter ,client side /Event based /object oriented scripting language.

1] defination :javascript=>
javascript is a single thread syncronous dynamic typed partial object oriented client side scripting language   used to 
static as well as dynamic web application.

i]single thread=>It means only one piece of code runs at a time in a single thread.
//programming language:Any language is used to perform operation on the data
ii]synchronous: which can handle single thing at a time is called as synchronous/one after another

iii]dynamically typed:
a=10;
a=12;
a="hello"


iv]During the execution of programming can change the data ordata type.

v]Client side : client side the give the information to the client (end user)  by using UI
vi]software industrythere aretwo types 
1]Scripting language
2]programming language

programm to run program :
compilation=>converting our understandable code in to machine language.
execution=>to exuted the computation
=======
datatype
data is the information on which we need to implement in bussiness logic to get  the desired
output.
ex var a=10;
var b=20;
var c=a+b;
console.log(c);
to perform any operation  on the database need to understand the datatype
typeof operation user the identifer the typeof data
their are two types of datatype 
1.primitive datatypes/built in datatype
2.non primitive datatype/ derived datatype
\
1.primitive datatypes/built in datatype
//-abilityto  stoward the data single value
 Always thestoward the data in stack memory directly
 a=10;

-once data has been created in the memory
--it is not to possible to change. it will is created a new memory locationto store the data.  
-so valueof variable will be changed

//always follow in LIFO (LAST IN FIRST OUT)
once created is called as immutability(fixed)
2 byte=>16 byte
-used for simple operation
types of primitive  data type
number

string =>denoted as '',"",''etc
Boolean
null
undefined
symbol(ES6)
in this all datatype not share the value in other variable/to work in LIFO Manner



Boolean: boolean data values can be represent with true or false.
null:null is special value give to any vaiable beacuse it is datatype is object


Non Primitive datatype/derived datatype:
-ability to stoward the multiple value
-once data will be store in heap memory with the refernce from stack memory 
-once data is been create in memory
once datawill be shared to another variable or sharing the
-it is not fixed size(daynamicaly to change)
-used for complex operation
-Always follow LIFO manner to perform the operation.
-it is called mutability.

type of non primitive
Array

Array is collection/combination of similar typeof or different datatype value(element).
suppose example
var a=[1,2,3,4];=>Array to number
var a=['a,'b'];=>Array of string
var arrayboolean=[true,false]=>Array of boolean
var arrauNull=[null,null];=>Array of null
var multipletypes=['1','2',3',null,'undefined'];

object
object:object are the collection of key value pair{key:value}
var numbers={
key1: value1',
key2: value2',
key3: value3',
key4: value4',
key5: value5',
}

(suppose to write the code in stack and heap which code first excuting =>first stack)
VIMP*******
Falsy value=>0,false,undefined,null,empty ,string
truth value => afat form this
null isthis valuenotfalsy or truth 
ex
// var  ss=null;
// if(ss){
// console.log('hello');
// }//blank space =>null
(ee!=0&ee!=undefined&&ee!=false&&ee!=null)


//4 point
